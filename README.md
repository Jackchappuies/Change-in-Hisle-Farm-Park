# Change-in-Hisle-Farm-Park
## Lidar Change in 2010 phase 1 land cover to 2019 Phase 2 land cover

Hisle Farm Park is a 280 acre park owned and operated by the city of Lexington. Phase one survey shows limited tree cover and mostly rolling pasture farm area of this park. Upon conducting phase two surveying in 2019, shown in blue on the map, we see much more forestation of the farm park. University of Kentucky ROTC conducts lab operations at this farm park every wednesday during the school year. Area of note - the pond located in the center of the park and map becomes surrounded by trees and I can confirm this due to the lab operations that occur in and around this pond!
